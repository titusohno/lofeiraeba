                            <p>So i'm going to go on IMDB and look at each MCU movies behind the scenes facts and POST THE MOST INTERESTING ONES here, I will post each movie a day instead of what I did before where I did 10 posts, I will start with the first Iron Man and each day will be the next MCU movie after it, ending with Guardians 3, I will also do the Netflix Shows, Agents of Shield and Agent Carter # ANT-MAN 1. At first, the film was meant to focus on the original Ant-Man, Hank Pym. However, Pym developed.

Yarbrou. Hi all, this is my first write up so any feedback would be great,I plan on doing a series of write ups on Canadian unsolved mysteries! There isn't much information on this case but here is what I could find. amp#x200B; William Mcintyre killed April, 24 1984 in Oakville, Ontario amp#x200B; It was 20 years ago this coming Easter Saturday when Ontario Provincial Police undercover officer Corporal William McIntyre was murdered in his Oakville apartment, a slaying never solved. There. This is part two of my Missing children of Virginia series! You can go back and read my first post on Jamal and Basil Abdul'Faruq here (https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/8wwkux/missing_children_of_virginia_jamal_abdulfaruq_and/) Also for clarification, Katelin Akers was 19 years old when she disappeared. She is still on the Virginia Missing and Exploited children's page, and therefore, anyone under the age of 20 at the time of disappearance will appear at some point # THE TOP 500 MOST INFLUENTIAL ROCK SONGS (According to the Rock amp Roll Hall of Fame, as of January 2012) amp#x200B; MOST INFLUENTIAL ROCK ARTISTS IN THE ROCK 'N' ROLL TOP 500 7 SONGS: The Beatles (John Lennon also has 3 more of his own) 6 SONGS: Elvis Presley 5 SONGS: The Rolling Stones; Bob Dylan; The Beach Boys 4 SONGS: Stevie Wonder; Michael Jackson/Jackson 5; Muddy Waters; Led Zeppelin; Robert Johnson;. As a film student I'm constantly coming across "must see films" which I haven't got around to watching yet, or I find myself in a situation where I get asked "how have you not seen name of film ; don't you study film?". I've also always found it hard to retain the large amount of information and history that comes with film study. I decided the best way to ensure I better retained all of this information wasn't to continue what I was doing which was trying to take it in from lectures, books. 
On the morning of December 25th 1946, people all across the USAO were greeted to the one gift everyone wanted for Christmas. Oliver Drax had been captured. London had fallen. The remaining British high command had opened channels for an immediate unconditional surrender. World War III was finally over. Children were finally going to have their fathers come home. Wives, sisters, girlfriends and mothers who had toiled in the factories to keep the men they cared for armed and able to fight. This is the first step of my year long movie marathon, picking what to watch. I'd like to keep my daily choice random so I will settle on 365 films in advance and use a random number generator each day to select my film. The list will run alphabetically with films being removed as they are watched. There are a few classics and films that friends have suggested that I already have, but I'm also open to some recommendations. New or old, I don't mind. I also don't mind subtitles. Hey, me again! Having done Part 5 (https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/686r27/part_5_stands_renamed_to_film/), I will now tackle Part 6. Before I go on, first, I must thank thespicave (u/thespicave) for helping me out with Jolyne, Pucci and Emporio's Stand. This Part was one of the most hardest to name, but thespicave really helped me. Unfortunately, I decided to change Jolyne's Stand name, but Pucci's Stand name remains. Anyway, let's go! Here's the list: Stone The following is thread (post) about the mystery surrounding the 1999 murder of Ricky McCormick. As well as the two cryptic notes realeased by the fbi years when they deemed it homicide due to undisclosed reasons. Below is Wikipedia link to case. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_McCormick%27s_encrypted_notes The following is my opinion only not fact; I have new hobby of unsolved mysteries. I read Mr.McCormick (victim) was taking a certain drug (edited out prescription drug comment I was trying to find a list of songs from comedy movies but couldn't find anything online that was very inclusive, so I decided to make one. My criteria was songs that are performed by a character in a comedy movie (either singing or playing an instrument), not including dance numbers (like in Napoleon Dynamite or Risky Business) or songs from animated films and musicals (Little Shop of Horrors, The Producers, etc.). I included goofball comedies, family comedies, romantic comedies, dark comedies. 
Sorry that they aren't in alphabetical order, the game I'm making requires them to be randomised. Any help would be much appreciated. 101 Dalmations American Pie Juno Of Mice and Men The Grand Budapest Hotel A Christmas Carol Kick-Ass Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Little Miss Sunshine Kes Aladdin Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Ring The Searchers The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Alice in Wonderland Raging Bull The Godfather. Bear with me on this one folks. I am covering two missing girls and one convicted murderer so this may get a bit lengthy. I am going to copy from certain sources and will notate where I've done so. As always, relevant links will be at the bottom. Tammy Lynn Akers and Angela Rader, both 14 years old were two friends who went missing on February 7th, 1977. Both girls were dropped off at William Ruffner Junior High by a relative of one of the girls. However, neither girl actually attended classes. The theme for May is: Musicals  The mere mention of musicals will elicit agonized groaning in some quarters and spontaneous bursts of song in others. The two reactions may represent a "chicken-and-egg" type cycle that's fundamentally irresolvable, but at this point the disagreement is entirely academic; If there's one genre that's certifiably colder than Julius Caesar in early April, it's the Hollywood musical. How did we get here? How did the musical, the genre that ushered. Hey, so I occasionally have some time and decided to make my episodes rewatch productive for dragkind, so I made this. It's basically a guide to pop culture references in RPDR and some pun explanations for those who aren't native English-speakers. I started with the first episode from Season 4 two weeks ago, since that's the episode that got me hooked on RPDR and it's also written in a way that is best for 1st time viewers. Now's episode episode 4 from season 4, with Untucked! Season 4 Episode. </p>
